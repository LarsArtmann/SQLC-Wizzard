## 📊 **g) TOP #1 UNANSWERED QUESTION:**

**How can we rapidly increase wizard package test coverage from 1.6% to 80% while ensuring tests provide real business value and detect actual bugs rather than just satisfying coverage metrics?**

**Specific Challenges:**

- **Wizard Package Size:** 270+ lines with complex CLI interactions
- **Test Framework Limitations:** Need to test huh.User interactions effectively
- **Integration Complexity:** Wizard coordinates between adapters, templates, and validation
- **Mock Strategy:** Need to mock external dependencies while testing real flows
- **Business Logic Coverage:** Ensure tests catch actual user workflow issues, not just edge cases

**Research Needed:**

- Best practices for testing CLI applications with huh framework
- Mock strategy for adapter pattern testing
- Integration testing approaches for wizard orchestration
- Coverage target prioritization (business-critical paths first)
