---

## ⚠️ b) PARTIALLY DONE WORK

### 1. **Test Coverage** ⚠️ (65% Complete)

**Current Coverage:**

- ✅ Domain layer: 83.6% (EXCELLENT)
- ✅ Errors: 98.1% (PERFECT)
- ✅ Schema: 98.1% (PERFECT)
- ✅ Migration: 96.0% (EXCELLENT)
- ✅ Utils: 92.9% (EXCELLENT)
- ✅ Validation: 91.7% (EXCELLENT)
- ✅ Templates: 64.8% (GOOD)
- ✅ Commands: 20.4% (NEEDS WORK)
- ✅ Adapters: 23.3% (NEEDS WORK)
- ⚠️ **Wizard: 2.9% (CRITICAL GAP)**

**Problem Despite Adding Tests:**

- Added `wizard_run_test.go` and `wizard_comprehensive_test.go`
- Added 40+ new test cases covering all project types, database types, and configurations
- Coverage still stuck at 2.9%

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**

- Tests may not be importing/running properly
- wizard.go file might have low testability
- Coverage tools may not be counting correctly
- Need to investigate test execution and file coverage

### 2. **Integration Testing** ⚠️ (40% Complete)

**What We Did:**

- ✅ Manual end-to-end testing of init command
- ✅ Verified sqlc.yaml generation works
- ✅ Verified SQL file generation works
- ✅ Tested all CLI help commands

**Still Missing:**

- ❌ Automated integration tests
- ❌ Real sqlc execution testing
- ❌ Cross-platform testing
- ❌ Error scenario testing

### 3. **Security Hardening** ⚠️ (50% Complete)

**What We Added:**

- ✅ Security scanning in CI/CD (gosec)
- ✅ Non-root Docker user
- ✅ Minimal Docker base image
- ✅ Dependency vulnerability scanning planned

**Missing:**

- ❌ Input sanitization
- ❌ Secure temporary file handling
- ❌ Security audit of dependencies
- ❌ Penetration testing

---

## ❌ c) NOT STARTED WORK (Significantly Reduced!)

### 1. **Performance Benchmarking** ❌ (20% Complete)

**Remaining:**

- ❌ Memory usage profiling
- ❌ Large project testing (100+ tables)
- ❌ Performance regression tests
- ❌ Resource usage monitoring

### 2. **Advanced Distribution** ❌ (10% Complete)

**Remaining:**

- ❌ Package manager releases (pnpm, cargo, etc.)
- ❌ IDE extensions (VS Code, GoLand)
- ❌ Web-based configuration generator
- ❌ Official website/landing page

### 3. **Enterprise Features** ❌ (0% Complete)

**Remaining:**

- ❌ Team collaboration features
- ❌ Configuration sharing
- ❌ Advanced validation
- ❌ Analytics and usage tracking

---

## 🚨 d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP AREAS

### 1. **Wizard Test Coverage** 🚨 (CRITICAL!)

**The Problem:**

- Despite adding 40+ comprehensive tests covering:
  - All project types (hobby, microservice, enterprise, api-first, analytics, testing, multi-tenant, library)
  - All database types (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
  - All configuration options
  - All validation scenarios
- Coverage remains at 2.9%

**Why This Happened:**

- Tests may not be executing the wizard.go file directly
- wizard.go contains UI logic that's hard to test
- Test coverage tool might not be counting correctly
- Possible import or execution issues

**IMMEDIATE DEBUGGING REQUIRED:**

```bash
# Check if tests are actually running
go test ./internal/wizard -v -run TestWizard

# Check coverage per file
go test -coverprofile=cover.out ./internal/wizard
go tool cover -func=cover.out | grep wizard.go

# Verify test files are being included
go test ./internal/wizard -list=. | grep wizard
```

### 2. **Commands Test Coverage** 🚨

**The Problem:**

- Commands module only 20.4% coverage
- This is user-facing CLI code that needs testing
- Could lead to production failures

**Impact:**

- CLI argument parsing not thoroughly tested
- Error handling in commands not validated
- User interaction flows could break

---
