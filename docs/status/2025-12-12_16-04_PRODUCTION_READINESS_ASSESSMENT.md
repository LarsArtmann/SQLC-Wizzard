## 🚨 d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP AREAS

### 1. **Wizard Test Coverage** 🚨

**The Problem:**

- Despite adding comprehensive tests, wizard coverage remains at 2.9%
- Tests are likely not covering the actual wizard.go file properly
- Core user interaction paths untested

**Why This Happened:**

- Tests may be testing template data but not actual wizard execution
- wizard.go contains UI logic that's hard to test
- Integration between wizard components untested

**Immediate Fix Required:**

- Add direct wizard.Run() method tests with mock UI
- Test actual user interaction flows
- Increase wizard.go file coverage to 80%+

### 2. **Distribution Strategy** 🚨

**The Problem:**

- No way for users to actually install the tool
- No CI/CD pipeline despite being "production ready"
- Cannot ship to users even though it works

**Impact:**

- Brilliant code that nobody can use
- Wasted development effort
- Poor developer experience

## 🎯 CONCLUSION

SQLC-Wizard is **70% production ready** with excellent technical foundations but lacks production-grade infrastructure. The core functionality is solid and well-designed, but critical gaps in testing, distribution, and production hardening prevent immediate deployment.

**Key Achievement:** Solid technical architecture with working CLI tool
**Critical Gap:** No way for users to actually install and use it
**Immediate Focus:** Set up CI/CD and distribution pipeline
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to full production readiness with focused effort

The project has excellent bones and can be production-ready quickly with focused effort on missing infrastructure components.
